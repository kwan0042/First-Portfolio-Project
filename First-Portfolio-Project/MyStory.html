                    <p id="content">
                    During my work time, I've thought about how to improve myself. I tried to discover my hobbies and my future career. Taking some courses, Learning new stuff become my daily life. Friends are also important to me.<br><br>

                    Meeting new friends is one of my hobbies. Having more friends is the way to build up my social network. I love to talk with them and learn from them. Thus, I enjoy meeting all of you.<br>

                    Another important thing about me is that creative work is very interesting for me. Like filming, photography, graphic design, video editing. I enjoy doing it by using my imagination. I had a sense of accomplishment after finishing these works. That's why I tried to be a graphic designer, videographer, and also photographer. All of these skills I learned myself.<br><br>

                    After that, I realize that studying experiences are necessary for our life. The world changes every day and we cannot just stay here to do nothing. Studying is the way to improve me. Experience is the way to avoid the threats and solve the problem. That is my belief.<br><br>
